We start with a list of possible variables in a model.
The article refers to each statistical model as an 'individual'

STEP 1
* Randomly generate P 'individuals', or different models in the format of 10011101001....0
	* '1' indicates that the respective variable is included in the model, 0 means it is not included
		* Example: we have these possible predictors for running speed: height, weight, age. 
		   	 * 101 means that only height and age are included in this particular model to predict speed
	* Choose C <= P <= 2C where C is the # of possible predictors

EACH ITERATION:

1) Calculate AIC (or some other power function) for each of the P models, indicating the strength of the model (or 'individual')
  	   * Rank each individual/model by AIC

2)  Follow this procedure:
       a) Draw 2 models without replacement from the list of P models of the t-1 iteration (the list of P models that we had from the iteration prior)
       	      * Sampling probabilities correspond to the AIC rankings (needs clarification)
  	      * Without replacement - donâ€™t want a model to be paired with itself (check if right)
       b) Put both models back into the sampling pool (of all P models)
       c) go back to a) and continue until we have drawn P models and P/2 model-pairs from t-1 iteration's list of P models
   Now we have P sampled models and P/2 pairs to work with.

3) Perform CROSSOVER and MUTATIONS on the pairs
  	  * First perform Crossover:
		* Ex: Our first pair is 10011011; 01001001
		      	Randomly choose cutoff = 3. 100|11011; 010|01001 --> 'offspring'\new models are: 10001001 or 01011011
  	  * Second, perform Mutations:
		* Find common values at same position on parent models.
			* In example above, there is a 0 in the 3rd position, 1 in 5th position, etc. for BOTH parents
		       	* The values of these in the offspring are eligible for mutations
		* Switch 0 to 1 (or 1 to 0) in some of the post-crossover eligible positions
			* Apply mutations at a low rate, probably 1% (see article)

WHEN TO STOP ITERATIONS
* From article p. 80:
	* Choose max number of iterations to begin with, or
	* Stop when genetic diversity within chromosomes in current generation is sufficiently low
		* i.e. when all the models have very similar variables
